# CheatSheet
Python Script that executes commands that are listed in an .ods sheet. The script must first run, then execute command based on row number of the command in the library.

Concept:
When multiple commonly used commands that are saved in the library need to be executed, you can do so numerically

Example:

$python3 cheatsheet.py

Enter Command Number: 1

The output of 1 you execute the first command listed in the library.
